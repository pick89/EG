# EG

First of all thanks to give me this opportunity, I have been a lot of fun to perform this Technical Assessment.

For this test I install some package npm like :

 - "cypress"  
 - "http-server"
 - "chai"
 - "cypress-file-upload"
 - "cypress-iframe"
 - "cypress-wait-until"
 - "prettier"

 When you try to run my test, don't forget to install them.

 My Plan for this test is to ensure all the component on the html on the file task.htlm.
 For that I begin by the test on the practice page part and finally  end to iFrame part.

 Enjoy
